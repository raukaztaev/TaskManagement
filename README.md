About the Project

This project is a task management system that allows users to create, edit, and track tasks. It includes a commenting feature so participants can discuss tasks and leave important notes.

The system has a role-based access control model, where each user has certain permissions based on their role. Authentication is handled through JWT tokens, ensuring secure and reliable access.
